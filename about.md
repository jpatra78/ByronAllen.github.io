##### Jeff Patra, Data Scientist

For 15 years I worked in a technical role exploring for hydrocarbons in the oil and gas industry.  Due to market contraction and volatility I made the decision to change careers and re-skill as a Data Scientist. I have always been involved with data and enjoy predictive modelling.  The best reward is demonstrating that your model predictions work!
